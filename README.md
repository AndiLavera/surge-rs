this repository contains the alpha release of
surge-synthesizer ported to rust.

it is possible that many runtime bugs have been
introduced into the codebase during the port.

it is possible there is a bug or more in every
function.

i plan to scrub it down before using it for
anything serious.

my thought is that even in its current state, it
may be useful to some of you, too.

i appreciate any support and/or bugfixes
contributed by others in the meantime.
