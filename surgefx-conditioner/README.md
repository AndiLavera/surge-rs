Audio conditioner effect for the Surge synthesizer
---

The `surgefx-conditioner` crate provides an audio
conditioner effect as a subcomponent of the Surge
synthesizer system. The conditioner effect helps
improve the overall sound quality and dynamics of
the audio signal by applying various processing
techniques such as equalization, compression, and
limiting.

The main struct provided by this crate is
`Conditioner`, which is responsible for the
processing and management of the conditioner
effect. The `Conditioner` struct has several
methods and fields related to its operation,
including:

- control_group
- control_type
- default_value
- max_value
- min_value
- modulateable
- moverate
- value_type
- update
- update_bands
- ConditionerProcessCfg
- do_conditioner_block
- increment_bufpos
- update_delayed
- update_filtered_lamax
- update_gain
- update_lamax

- conditioner_smoke
- init
- process
- process_bands
- process_mid_side
- process_only_control
- process_postamp
- set_vu01
- set_vu45
- update_amp

The conditioner effect applies several
mathematical operations to the input audio signal,
including filtering, gain adjustments, and
dynamics processing. These operations involve
mathematical equations such as transfer functions,
frequency-domain transformations, and time-domain
processing. The specific equations used depend on
the implementation details and chosen processing
techniques.

Some key mathematical concepts involved in the
conditioner effect include:

1. **Equalization**: Applying frequency-domain
   filtering to modify the amplitude response of
   the audio signal at specific frequency
   bands. This can involve operations such as
   convolution or multiplication in the frequency
   domain.

2. **Compression**: Reducing the dynamic range of
   the audio signal by attenuating the amplitude
   of signals above a specified threshold. This
   process typically involves calculating a gain
   reduction factor based on the input signal's
   amplitude and a user-defined ratio.

3. **Limiting**: Preventing the audio signal from
   exceeding a specified amplitude threshold by
   applying a hard limit on its peaks. This
   process can be seen as an extreme form of
   compression with a high ratio and fast
   attack/release times.

By combining these processing techniques, the
`surgefx-conditioner` crate helps enhance the
sound quality and dynamics of the audio signal,
making it suitable for use within the Surge
synthesizer system.

Keep in mind that this description assumes
a typical audio conditioner effect based on the

specific implementation might vary, so please
adjust the description as needed to accurately
reflect your implementation.

14> could you teach me how a conditioner works?
what about a detailed block diagram? are there any
useful variants?

A conditioner is an audio processing unit designed
to improve the overall sound quality and dynamics
of an audio signal. It typically consists of
several stages, such as equalization, compression,
and limiting, which work together to enhance the
audio signal's tonal balance and dynamic
range. Here's a detailed block diagram of
a typical audio conditioner:

1. **Input Signal**: The audio signal that you
   want to process with the conditioner.

2. **Equalization**: This stage applies
   frequency-domain filtering to modify the
   amplitude response of the audio signal at
   specific frequency bands. Equalization can be
   achieved using various filter types (e.g.,
   low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, etc.)
   and can either boost or cut the signal's
   amplitude at the desired frequencies.

3. **Compression**: This stage reduces the dynamic
   range of the audio signal by attenuating the
   amplitude of signals above a specified
   threshold. Compression helps to control the
   signal's peaks, making the overall sound more
   consistent and balanced. A compressor typically
   has user-adjustable parameters such as
   threshold, ratio, attack, and release times,
   which determine the amount and character of the
   compression applied.

4. **Limiting**: This stage prevents the audio
   signal from exceeding a specified amplitude
   threshold by applying a hard limit on its
   peaks. A limiter can be seen as an extreme form
   of compression with a high ratio and fast
   attack/release times. Limiting is often used to
   prevent clipping and distortion in the output
   signal, especially when used in a mastering
   context.

5. **Output Signal**: The processed audio signal,
   which has been equalized, compressed, and
   limited to improve its overall sound quality
   and dynamics.

There are several useful variants of audio
conditioners, some of which may include additional
processing stages or focus on specific aspects of
the conditioning process:

1. **Multiband Conditioner**: This type of
   conditioner splits the input signal into
   multiple frequency bands and applies separate
   equalization, compression, and limiting to each
   band. This approach provides more precise
   control over the conditioning process and can
   yield better results, especially when dealing
   with complex or problematic audio signals.

2. **Dynamic Equalizer**: A dynamic equalizer
   combines the functionality of an equalizer and
   a compressor, adjusting the equalization
   settings based on the input signal's
   amplitude. This type of conditioner can provide
   more transparent and natural-sounding results
   compared to traditional equalizers and
   compressors.

3. **Stereo Conditioner**: A stereo conditioner
   processes the left and right channels of
   a stereo signal separately or jointly,
   depending on the desired effect. This type of
   conditioner can enhance the stereo image and
   provide more control over the spatial aspects
   of the audio signal.

4. **Mid-Side Conditioner**: This variant
   processes the mid (sum of left and right) and
   side (difference between left and right)
   components of a stereo signal separately,
   allowing for precise control over the stereo
   width and balance. Mid-side conditioning can be
   particularly useful for mastering applications,
   where maintaining a balanced and well-defined
   stereo image is crucial.

These variants and others can be tailored to
specific applications or combined to create more
versatile and powerful audio conditioning
solutions.
