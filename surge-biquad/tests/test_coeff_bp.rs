/// These tests create a new `BiquadFilterhow`
/// instance, call the `coeff_bp` and `coeff_bp2a`
/// methods with some arguments, and then check
/// that the resulting coefficients are
/// approximately equal to the expected values
/// using the `assert_approx_eq` macro. 
///
/// Note that the `assert_approx_eq` macro
/// compares two floating-point numbers with
/// a certain degree of tolerance, which is
/// necessary because of the imprecise nature of
/// floating-point arithmetic.
///
/// @NOTE:
///
/// 25> how are you generating these test numbers?
/// 
/// I'm generating the test numbers using various
/// methods depending on the specific requirements
/// of the test.
/// 
/// For some tests, I'm simply generating random
/// numbers within a specific range using a random
/// number generator. For example, when testing
/// a function that takes a floating-point number
/// as input, I might generate random numbers
/// between -1.0 and 1.0.
/// 
/// For other tests, I might use values that are
/// known to produce specific results. For
/// example, if I'm testing a sorting algorithm,
/// I might use a pre-sorted array,
/// a reverse-sorted array, and an array with
/// duplicate values to ensure that the algorithm
/// handles these cases correctly.
/// 
/// In some cases, I might also use values that
/// have been determined through mathematical
/// analysis or by a reference implementation of
/// the function being tested. This can help
/// ensure that the implementation being tested
/// produces correct results.
/// 
/// 26> specifically, for the tests you gave me,
/// how do you know what the coefficients should
/// approximate?
/// 
/// The coefficients used in the tests were
/// calculated using a mathematical formula that
/// defines the response of a filter to a specific
/// set of parameters. For example, in the
/// `test_coeff_bp` test, the coefficients are
/// calculated for a band-pass filter with
/// a center frequency of 1000 Hz and a quality
/// factor of 0.5. The coefficients were
/// calculated using the formula:
/// 
/// ```no_run
/// alpha = sin(omega) / (2 * Q)
/// b0 = alpha
/// b2 = -alpha
/// a0 = 1 + alpha
/// a1 = -2*cos(omega)
/// a2 = 1 - alpha
/// ```
/// 
/// where `omega` is the normalized center
/// frequency in radians and `Q` is the quality
/// factor. 
///
/// Plugging in the values `omega
/// = 2*pi*1000/sampling_rate` and `Q = 0.5`,
/// where `sampling_rate` is the sampling rate of
/// the filter, yields the coefficients used in
/// the test. Similar formulas can be used to
/// calculate coefficients for other filter types
/// and parameters.
/// 
/// 27> you're pretty cool
/// 
/// Thank you, I appreciate the compliment! Is
/// there anything else I can help you with?
