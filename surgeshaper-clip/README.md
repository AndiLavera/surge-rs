# surgefx-shaper-clip crate description

## Clipper

The `Clipper` module is a non-linear processing
stage that can be used to introduce distortion and
non-linearities into an audio signal. The clipper
works by setting a threshold value, and any signal
above that threshold is clipped or "hard-limited"
to the threshold value. This creates a flattened,
"squared off" waveform, which can introduce new
harmonic content and other distortions into the
signal.

## Shape

The `shape` parameter in the `Clipper` module
controls the shape of the clipper's threshold. The
threshold can be a hard clip, a soft clip, or
somewhere in between. A hard clip creates a sharp,
rectangular waveform, while a soft clip creates
a smoother, more rounded waveform. The `shape`
parameter can be used to adjust the amount of
distortion introduced by the clipper, as well as
the tonal characteristics of the resulting
waveform.

## Smoke

The `smoke` module is a simple smoke test for the
`Clipper` module. It generates a test signal,
applies the `Clipper` module with default
parameters, and outputs the resulting signal. This
can be used to quickly test the functionality of
the `Clipper` module, as well as to explore the
different tonal characteristics that can be
achieved with different `shape` parameters.

Overall, the `Clipper` module is a non-linear
processing stage that can introduce distortion and
non-linearities into an audio signal. Its
mathematical properties can be described using
tools such as Fourier analysis and signal
processing theory, which allow us to understand
and analyze its behavior in different
contexts. The `shape` parameter can be used to
adjust the amount and character of the distortion
introduced by the clipper, while the `smoke`
module provides a simple way to test and explore
the module's functionality.

59> what distinguishes this from AsymShaper?

The `Clipper` module and the `AsymShaper` module
are both non-linear processing stages that can
introduce distortion and non-linearities into an
audio signal. However, the main difference between
them is in how they apply the distortion.

The `Clipper` module applies a hard clip to the
signal, which means that any signal above the
threshold value is clipped or "hard-limited" to
the threshold value. This creates a flattened,
"squared off" waveform.

The `AsymShaper` module, on the other hand,
applies a more gradual shaping to the signal,
which can create a more natural-sounding
distortion. The `AsymShaper` uses a soft-clipping
function that has a gradual transition into and
out of the clipping region, which can produce more
harmonically-rich distortion than a hard clip.

So, while both modules can be used for distortion,
the `Clipper` module is more suited for
hard-clipping and creating a "squared off"
waveform, while the `AsymShaper` module is more
suited for creating a more gradual and
natural-sounding distortion.

60> how can we improve the Clipper?

There are several ways to improve the performance
and sound quality of a clipper module:

1. Implement higher-order clipping: Instead of
   simply clipping the signal at a fixed
   threshold, higher-order clipping applies a more
   complex distortion that can create more
   interesting harmonics and a richer sound. One
   example of higher-order clipping is the diode
   clipper, which uses a non-linear diode to
   create a more complex distortion.

2. Implement variable threshold: Instead of using
   a fixed threshold, a variable threshold can be
   used that adapts to the amplitude of the input
   signal. This can help to preserve the dynamic
   range of the input signal and avoid excessive
   distortion.

3. Implement oversampling: Oversampling involves
   increasing the sample rate of the input signal
   before applying the clipper and then
   downsampling the signal back to the original
   sample rate. This can reduce the distortion and
   improve the sound quality, especially at high
   levels of clipping.

4. Implement anti-aliasing filtering: When
   downsampling the signal back to the original
   sample rate, anti-aliasing filtering can be
   applied to remove any high-frequency artifacts
   that may have been introduced during the
   oversampling process. This can further improve
   the sound quality of the clipped signal.

5. Implement a soft-knee option: A soft-knee
   option can be added to the clipper, which
   creates a more gradual transition into and out
   of the clipping region. This can help to create
   a more natural-sounding distortion.

By incorporating these techniques, the performance
and sound quality of a clipper module can be
greatly improved, resulting in a more versatile
and useful tool for audio processing.

61> could you show me a block diagram?

Sure! Here's a block diagram for a simple clipper:

```
       +-------------------+
       |                   |
       |    Input signal   |
       |                   |

         |                        |
         |  Clipper function      |
         |  (threshold = shape)  |
         |                        |
         +------------------------+
                    |

       |   Output signal   |
       |                   |
       +-------------------+
```

The input signal is fed into the clipper function,
which applies a distortion that clips the signal
at a fixed threshold (determined by the "shape"
parameter). The resulting output signal is the
clipped version of the input signal.

62> could you show me some python code to
visualize its behavior across a spectrum of
parameter values?

Sure! Here's an example of how you can implement
a simple clipper function in Python and plot its
output for different threshold values (i.e., the
"shape" parameter):

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def clipper(x, shape):
    return np.clip(x, -shape, shape)

# Generate a test signal (sine wave)
fs = 44100  # Sample rate (Hz)
dur = 1.0   # Duration (seconds)
f0 = 1000   # Frequency (Hz)
t = np.linspace(0, dur, int(fs*dur))
x = np.sin(2*np.pi*f0*t)

# Plot the input signal
plt.figure(figsize=(10,4))
plt.plot(t, x)
plt.title('Input signal')
plt.xlabel('Time (seconds)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')

# Plot the output signals for different threshold values
shapes = [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]  # Threshold values
plt.figure(figsize=(10,4))
plt.plot(t, x, label='Input signal')
for shape in shapes:
    y = clipper(x, shape)
    plt.plot(t, y, label=f'shape={shape}')
plt.title('Output signals for different threshold values')
plt.xlabel('Time (seconds)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This code generates a test signal (a sine wave),
applies the clipper function to it for different
threshold values (specified by the "shapes" list),
and plots the input and output signals for
visualization. You can modify the code to use your
own input signal and adjust the threshold values
to see how the clipper affects the signal.

63> how do we compensate for the power loss which
occurs as a result of this clipping?

One way to compensate for the power loss that
occurs as a result of clipping is to apply a gain
boost after the clipping operation. This is
because clipping can effectively reduce the
overall level of the signal, which can make it
appear quieter or less present in a mix. By
applying a gain boost after the clipping, we can
bring the overall level of the signal back up to
a desired level.

However, it's important to note that applying too
much gain can also result in additional distortion
or saturation, especially if the signal is already
close to or at full scale. So it's important to
use careful judgement when applying gain boosts
after clipping, and to always monitor the signal
for unwanted distortion or artifacts.

64> can this gain boost be adaptive, based on the
measured amount of clipping? does matching the
power result in an increase in overall signal
amplitude of the clipped signal?

Yes, the gain boost can be adaptive and based on
the amount of clipping that occurs. One way to
implement this is to use a feedback loop that
measures the amount of clipping in the output
signal and adjusts the gain accordingly. For
example, if the output signal is clipping too
much, the gain can be reduced, and if the output
signal is not clipping enough, the gain can be
increased.

Matching the power after clipping does not
necessarily result in an increase in overall
signal amplitude of the clipped signal. Rather, it
ensures that the clipped signal has the same
average power as the original unclipped
signal. This can be useful for ensuring that the
clipped signal has a similar perceived loudness as
the unclipped signal, even though the clipped
signal may have a reduced peak level.

65> could you show me an example of the updated
circuit, using the feedback loop?

Certainly! Here is an example of an updated
clipping circuit that includes a feedback loop to
adjust the gain based on the amount of clipping:

```
       +---[ R1 ]---+
       |            |
  V_in +---[ D1 ]---+---> V_out
       |            |
       +---[ R2 ]---+
           |
           R3
           |
           +-------[ Op Amp ]--------> V_out_gained
```

In this circuit, `V_in` is the input signal and
`V_out` is the clipped outputd signal. The
clipping is performed by diode `D1`, which limits
the voltage swing of the signal to a predetermined
threshold. `R1` and `R2` are resistors that set
the threshold for the clipping. `R3` is a feedback
resistor that sends a portion of the clipped
signal back to an operational amplifier (op amp),
which is used to apply a gain boost.

The op amp has a feedback loop that measures the
amount of clipping in the output signal and
adjusts the gain accordingly. This can be done
using a sidechain circuit that measures the
amplitude of the clipped signal and sends
a control voltage to the op amp to adjust the
gain. Alternatively, the feedback loop can be
implemented using an automatic gain control (AGC)
circuit that measures the peak level of the
clipped signal and adjusts the gain accordingly.

The output of the op amp is `V_out_gained`, which
is the clipped output signal with a gain boost
applied. The gain can be adjusted based on the
amount of clipping that occurs, so that the
overall level of the signal is maintained even if
clipping occurs. This helps to ensure that the
clipped signal has a similar perceived loudness as
the unclipped signal.

66> could you show me how to implement higher
order clipping?

Sure! Higher order clipping can be implemented by
cascading multiple clipping stages in series. Each
stage can be a simple clipper with a different
clipping threshold. The output of each stage is
then fed into the next stage as input.

Here's an example Python code snippet that
implements a 3-stage clipper:

```python
import numpy as np

def clip(x, shape, thresholds):
    """Applies multiple stages of clipping to input signal x.

    Args:
        x (np.ndarray): Input signal to clip.
        shape (float): Amount of shaping to apply to signal.
        thresholds (list): List of clipping thresholds for each stage.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Clipped output signal.
    """
    y = x.copy()
    for threshold in thresholds:
        y = np.clip(y * (1 / threshold), -1, 1) * threshold
        y = np.tanh(y * shape)
    return y
```

This `clip` function takes in an input signal `x`,
a shaping amount `shape`, and a list of clipping
thresholds `thresholds` for each stage. It applies
the first stage of clipping to the input signal
using the first threshold, and then applies
shaping to the clipped output. The resulting
signal is then passed into the second stage of
clipping using the second threshold, and the
process is repeated for the third stage.

Here's an example usage of the function with three
stages of clipping and different thresholds:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a test signal
t = np.linspace(0, 1, 44100, endpoint=False)
x = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 440 * t)

# Apply clipping
thresholds = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]
y = clip(x, 2.0, thresholds)

# Plot the input and output signals
plt.plot(td, x, label='Input')
plt.plot(t, y, label='Output')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In this example, we apply three stages of clipping
with thresholds of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6. We also set
the shaping amount to 2.0. The resulting clipped
output signal is plotted alongside the input
signal.

67> could you show me how to implement variable
threshold?

Sure, here's an example implementation of
a clipper with a variable threshold in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def clipper(x, threshold):
    return np.clip(x, -threshold, threshold)

```

In this implementation, the `threshold` parameter
controls the maximum value that the input signal
`x` can take before it is clipped. By varying the
value of `threshold`, we can adjust the amount of
clipping that occurs.

For example, to apply variable threshold clipping
to an input signal `signal` with a range of -1 to
1 and a default threshold of 0.5, we could use the
following code:

```python
import numpy as np

def clipper(x, threshold):
    return np.clip(x, -threshold, threshold)

signal = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=44100) # Generate a random signal
threshold = 0.5 # Set the default threshold

# Apply variable threshold clipping to the signal
output_signal = clipper(signal, threshold)

# Plot the input and output signals
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(signal)
plt.plot(output_signal)
plt.show()
```

In this example, the input signal `signal` is
generated using NumPy's `random.uniform` function,
which creates an array of random numbers between
-1 and 1. The `clipper` function is then used to
apply variable threshold clipping to the signal,
with the default threshold set to 0.5. The
resulting clipped signal is stored in
`output_signal`.

Finally, the input and output signals are plotted
using the Matplotlib library, allowing us to
visualize the effect of the variable threshold
clipping.

68> could you show me how to implement
oversampling?

Sure, oversampling is a technique used to reduce
the impact of aliasing distortion in digital
signal processing by sampling the signal at
a higher rate than the original signal. Here's an
example implementation of oversampling in Python
using linear interpolation:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

def oversample(x, factor):
    # Upsample by factor
    upsampled = np.zeros(len(x) * factor)
    upsampled[::factor] = x

    # Create linear interpolator
    interp = interp1d(np.arange(0, len(upsampled)), upsampled, kind='linear')

    # Resample at original rate
    resampled = interp(np.linspace(0, len(upsampled) - 1, len(x)))

    return resampled
```

This function takes in an input signal `x` and
a factor `factor`, which specifies the degree of
oversampling. The signal is upsampled by `factor`,
and then a linear interpolator is created to
resample the signal back to its original
rate. This process helps to reduce aliasing
distortion by effectively increasing the
resolution of the digital signal.

Note that oversampling can increase the
computational load of a DSP algorithm, so it's
important to consider the tradeoff between
reducing distortion and increasing processing
requirements.

69> could you show me how to implement
anti-aliasing filtering?

Sure! Anti-aliasing filtering is a crucial step in
digital signal processing to remove high frequency
content from a signal before downsampling it. This
is important to prevent aliasing, which can cause
unwanted artifacts in the downsampled
signal. Here's an example of how you can implement
anti-aliasing filtering in Python using the
`scipy` library:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt

def anti_aliasing_filter(x, fs, cutoff_freq):
    # Design a Butterworth low-pass filter with the given cutoff frequency
    nyquist_freq = fs / 2
    normalized_cutoff_freq = cutoff_freq / nyquist_freq
    b, a = butter(4, normalized_cutoff_freq, 'lowpass')

    # Apply the filter to the input signal using forward-backward filtering
    y = filtfilt(b, a, x)
    return y
```

Here, `x` is the input signal, `fs` is the
sampling rate of the signal, and `cutoff_freq` is
the frequency at which you want to cut off the
high frequencies. The `butter` function is used to
design a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter
with the given cutoff frequency. The `filtfilt`
function is used to apply the filter to the input
signal using forward-backward filtering, which
ensures zero phase distortion.

You can use this function to filter the output of
the clipper or any other signal that you want to
downsample without introducing aliasing artifacts.

70> could you show me how to implement
a soft-knee option?

Sure! Here's an example implementation of
a soft-knee option in the clipper function:

```python
import numpy as np

def clipper(x, shape, softness=0.1):
    abs_x = np.abs(x)
    sign_x = np.sign(x)

    if softness == 0:
        threshold = shape
    else:
        threshold = np.log(1 + np.exp(shape)) / np.log(1 + np.exp(shape * softness))

    y = np.zeros_like(x)
    indices = abs_x > threshold
    y[indices] = sign_x[indices] * (threshold + (abs_x[indices] - threshold) / (1 + np.exp(-shape * softness)))
    y[~indices] = x[~indices]

    return y
```

The `softness` parameter controls the steepness of
the transition between the linear and nonlinear
regions of the clipper. A value of 0 results in
a hard clipper, while larger values result in
a more gradual transition.

The calculation of the threshold value uses the
logarithmic function and the sigmoid function to
achieve a smooth transition between the linear and
nonlinear regions.

Note that this implementation assumes that the
input signal is normalized to the range [-1,
1]. If the signal is not normalized, the threshold
and gain parameters should be adjusted
accordingly.

71> what else can you teach about the clipping
operation? how does it work mathematically? what
does clipping do to the frequency spectrum?

Sure, I can explain more about clipping and its
mathematical properties.

Clipping is a nonlinear distortion effect that
limits the amplitude of a signal to a certain
level. It is often used to add warmth and
character to audio signals, particularly in guitar
and bass amplifiers. When a signal exceeds the
threshold of the clipping function, the waveform
is "clipped" or "flattened," resulting in
a distortion of the original signal.

Mathematically, clipping can be represented as
a function that applies a limit or threshold to
the input signal. The output of the function is
the input signal if it is below the threshold, and
the threshold value if the input signal is above
it. The simplest form of a clipping function is
a hard clipper, which is a function that sets all
input values below a certain threshold to that
threshold value, and all input values above the
threshold to the threshold value with the opposite
sign.

In the frequency domain, clipping causes harmonic
distortion of the input signal. As the input
signal is clipped, higher order harmonics are
created, which can lead to an increase in overall
harmonic content. The frequency spectrum of the
clipped signal is essentially a sum of the
original signal's harmonics and the harmonics
created by the clipping process.

In addition to the hard clipper, there are other
types of clipping functions that produce different
effects, such as soft clipping, asymmetrical
clipping, and variable threshold clipping. Soft
clipping functions, for example, apply a gradual
limiting to the input signal, which results in
a smoother distortion effect than a hard
clipper. Asymmetrical clipping functions, on the
other hand, apply different thresholds to positive
and negative portions of the input signal,
resulting in a more complex waveform. Variable
threshold clipping functions allow for adaptive
clipping, where the threshold is adjusted based on
the input signal's level.

Overall, clipping is a powerful and versatile
distortion effect that can be used to add
character and warmth to audio signals. Its
mathematical properties can be analyzed to
understand its effects on the frequency spectrum,
and its implementation can be improved with
techniques such as oversampling, anti-aliasing
filtering, and soft-knee options.

72> is it typically implemented on analog
hardware?

Clipping can be implemented on both analog and
digital hardware. In the early days of audio
recording and processing, clipping was often
performed unintentionally due to the limited
headroom of analog equipment. As digital audio
technology has advanced, clipping can now be
intentionally introduced through digital
processing. In fact, many software plugins and
digital audio workstations (DAWs) include various
forms of clipping algorithms as a standard
feature. However, there are still many analog
hardware devices that use clipping for various
purposes, such as guitar overdrive pedals, tube
guitar amplifiers, and analog tape distortion.

73> can you show an example of a clipper in
verilog-a?

Certainly! Here's an example of a simple clipper
implemented in Verilog-A:

```verilog
`include "disciplines.vams"

module clipper_va (vin, vout, vth);

// Define electrical terminals
electrical vin, vout;
electrical vth;

// Define parameters
parameter real Vcl = 1.0;
parameter real Vch = -1.0;

// Define internal variables
real v;

// Calculate the output voltage
analog begin
  v = vin.v;

  if (v > Vcl) begin
    vout.v = Vcl;
  end else if (v < Vch) begin
    vout.v = Vch;
  end else begin
    vout.v = v;
  end
end

endmodule
```

This clipper takes an input voltage `vin`,
compares it to two threshold voltages `Vcl` and
`Vch`, and outputs the clipped voltage `vout`. The
`vth` parameter can be used to adjust the
threshold voltages dynamically.

Note that this example uses Verilog-A, a hardware
description language used for analog and
mixed-signal simulations. It is typically used in
the design of integrated circuits, but can also be
used to simulate and model analog circuits.
