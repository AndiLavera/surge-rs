1) "scan music library for all four bar loopable
   sections containing no vocals and primarily
   drums. extract and slice these into sample
   banks, granularizing and warping to the closest
   of 75, 90, 110, or 128 bpm. lightly filter out
   unnecessary audio frequencies and normalize to
   -3db."

2) "scan music library for vocal sections performed
   at a detectable BPM over melodic instruments
   and/or synthesizers but no drums. extract and
   chop these into 1/16ths, or at the note
   onsets. create a rust crate (ie, virtual code
   instrument) for each which can be triggered at
   each of these points via a simple function
   call."

3) "load three modular synthesizer components as
   code and search for an optimal synth
   architecture, balancing complexity with
   performance. take the top 5 configurations and
   train them to synthesize desirable audio
   snippets given an input sequence of midi loops"

4) "using a massive and unorganized sample library
   as an input, build a streamlined sample library
   of 500 one shot audio samples such that no two
   are alike,
   - trim the tails 
   - ensure only high quality samples
   - ensure mono only or appropriate stereo
     balance
   - ensure useful frequency content only
   - ensure no audio damage, ie clean waveforms
   - ensure the harmonic content is either
     pitchless, or pitched appropriately, indexed
     to a semitone in one of the following scales
     and tunings"

5) build a classifier for synthesis presets found
   in the following 5 synths. use it to filter
   a *massive* amount of sound presets down into
   just those i will find useful in making the
   following X styles of music...
